# My LED Project

## Description
* When the code runs: RED LEDs turn on 
* After two senconds the program ran, the RED LEDs turn off, and the BLUE LEDs turn on
* After pushing the button the BLUE LEDs turn off
## Sudo Code
* configure pin settings
* save time in start_time
* initiatilize LEDs
* while True
** calculate elapsed_time using time() and start_time
* check value input pin
* if button is down
** pull output pins LOW
* if ellapsed_time < 5
** set LED configuration 1
* else
** set LED configuration 2
## Lessons Learned
* Understand how to create circuits programing Raspberry pi
* Understand ditigal input and output applied into a physical computing  
* How Ellapse time works
* Better understanding to use while loops, and if and else statements
* First time using raspberry pi so the entire process of using code applied to electronics was very interesting.
